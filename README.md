This Repository contains Frontal Face Detection Using Haar Cascade(Viola-Jones Algorithm)

Viola-Jones is the first object detection algorithm used primarily for solving Face Detection Problem.

The Algorithm works in 4 Stages.
1. Haar Feature Selection
2. Creating an Integral Image.
3. Adaboost Training
4. Cascading Classifiers

Here we have implemented it using Opencv library
Dependency: OpenCv ,Python3
